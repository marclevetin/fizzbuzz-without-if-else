# fizzbuzz-without-if-else

This is just a little thought experiment to complete the fizzbuzz challege without if/else.

The idea came about from a conversation with a student about the pros and cons of `for` loops and `if`/`else` conditionals in javascript.  The position was that shorter was better and `const` rules the roost above all else.

As my go to for fizzbuzz was to if/else if/else it through the array, I thought I'd try out something else to see how it felt.

Special thanks to Joe Sutton and Joel Thoms for the research help.
